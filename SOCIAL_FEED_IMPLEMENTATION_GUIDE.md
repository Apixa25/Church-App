# üöÄ **Church App Social Feed Implementation Guide**

## üéØ **Overview**
This guide provides a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to implementing X.com-style social feed functionality for the Church App. The social feed will expand the existing "Recent Activity" system into a full-featured community posting platform with text, images, videos, likes, comments, and shares.

## üèõÔ∏è **Church Community Design Philosophy**
**Important Design Decision**: Unlike X.com/Twitter, this social feed uses a **church community model** where:
- ‚úÖ **Everyone sees everyone's posts** (no following system required)
- ‚úÖ **Community-focused**: Promotes unity and connection
- ‚úÖ **Simplified**: Easier for church members of all ages
- ‚úÖ **Future-ready**: Following system can be added if community grows significantly
- ‚úÖ **Appropriate**: Matches church culture where transparency and community are valued

## üìã **Prerequisites**
- ‚úÖ Current Church App codebase (backend + frontend)
- ‚úÖ Existing Recent Activity system working
- ‚úÖ AWS S3 configured for media storage
- ‚úÖ WebSocket infrastructure in place
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication system
- ‚úÖ PostgreSQL database with existing schema
