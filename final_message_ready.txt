## Fix Applied
- 🎯 Hooked the retry button to an inline handler (() => loadGroups()) so TypeScript no longer treats our async loader as a MouseEventHandler, aligning with project-vision.md §1’s focus on smooth UX for every user flow.
- 🏗️ Keeps our social-only gating from MULTI_TENANT_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md intact while ensuring the error-retry pathway remains additive and non-breaking.
- 🧪 Tests not re-run (tiny UI fix); please run 
pm run lint && npm run test inside rontend if you’d like extra assurance.

## Simplified Snippet
`rontend/src/components/ChatList.tsx
<button onClick={() => loadGroups()} className="retry-button">
`
