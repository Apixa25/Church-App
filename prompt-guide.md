Integrations: Google OAuth 2.0 for auth, Firebase Cloud Messaging for notifications, Stripe for payments, AWS S3 for storage.

Development Order: 1. Signup/Login, 2. User Profiles, 3. Home/Dashboard, 4. Chats/Social Network, 5. Prayer Requests, 6. Announcements, 7. Calendar/Events, 8. Resources/Library, 9. Giving/Donations, 10. Admin Tools, 11. Settings/Help.

Start by setting up the project structure: Create a Spring Boot backend with PostgreSQL connection (include application.properties for DB config), and a React frontend with Capacitor initialized. Implement REST APIs with proper error handling, security, and CORS.

Now, implement Section 1: Signup/Login. This is the initial screen for authentication. Support Google Auth (OAuth 2.0) and email/password. Collect basic info (name, email) and create/link to user profile. Use Spring Security for backend auth, JWT for tokens. Frontend: React form with Google button, redirect to dashboard on success. Generate complete code for backend entities/services/controllers/repositories for users table, and frontend components/screens.

Prompt #2
Continuing the Church App project with the tech stack and database schema from before. Assume Section 1 (Signup/Login) is implemented.

Implement Section 2: User Profiles. Allows users to set up/edit profiles (name, photo, bio, church role). Links to subgroup invites and personalizes the app. Backend: API endpoints for GET/PUT user profile, integrate with S3 for photo uploads. Frontend: React screen with form (use React Hook Form), display profile info. Integrate with auth from Signup/Login (use JWT for protected routes).
Generate complete code for this section, building on existing project.

Prompt #3
Continuing the Church App project with the tech stack and database schema from before. Assume Sections 1-2 are implemented.

Implement Section 3: Home/Dashboard. Centralized hub with a feed of recent activity (new chats, prayers, announcements, events). Includes quick access buttons to other sections and a notification center. Backend: API endpoint to aggregate recent data (use joins for feed). Frontend: React dashboard component with feed list, navigation links (React Router), and notification display (prep for FCM integration). Pull user data from profiles.
Generate complete code for this section, integrating with prior sections.

Prompt #4
Continuing the Church App project with the tech stack and database schema from before. Assume Sections 1-3 are implemented.

Implement Section 4: Chats/Social Network. Church-wide group chat and subgroups (e.g., men's, women's). Supports text, emojis, media, private messaging, searchable history. Admins moderate. Backend: APIs for groups/messages, use Spring WebSocket for real-time. Frontend: React chat screens with Socket.io for live updates, message input, history fetch via Axios. Tie to user profiles for authorship.

Prompt #5
Continuing the Church App project with the tech stack and database schema from before. Assume Sections 1-4 are implemented.

Implement Section 5: Prayer Requests. Post, track, update requests with anonymity, categories, status. Reactions ("pray"), comments, reminders. Sortable feed. Backend: APIs for CRUD on prayers/interactions, notifications. Frontend: React screen with form, list view, interaction buttons. Integrate with chats for similar real-time if needed, and dashboard feed.
