# NGINX Configuration - Increase Upload Size Limit
# This fixes the "client intended to send too large body" error
# Spring Boot allows up to 500MB, but NGINX default is 1MB
# Increased timeouts to handle large video uploads (500MB can take several minutes)
#
# NOTE: This configuration is applied during deployment.
# For Elastic Beanstalk Java platform, this file is placed in /etc/nginx/conf.d/
# which is automatically included by the main nginx.conf
